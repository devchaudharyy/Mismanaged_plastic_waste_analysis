# Mismanaged_plastic_waste_analysis
Mismanaged plastic waste is plastic that is either littered or inadequately disposed. A country's total does not include waste that is exported overseas, where it may be mismanaged.
In this notebook, we are going to analyse a dataset conataing data of mismanaged plastic waste produced by countries all over world with an additional data of mismanaged plastic waste produced per capita ( country-wise ) of the year 2019 and 2010.
We will compare the 2019 and 2010 data on different aspects and will learn about the trends of each year. We will use different visualisation tools, like bar chart, pie chart, to interpret the data more easily and get deep knowledge.
Different libraries worked on :-
Pandas
